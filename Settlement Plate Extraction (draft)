Protocol:
!!! ALL PHENOL/CHOLROFORM STEPS TO BE CONDUCTED IN A FUME HOOD !!!

1)  *Insert bead beating tissue method here*

2)  Transfer sample into a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube containing 60μL lysis buffer and 5μL 20mg/ul Proteinase K. Incubate at 60°C for 3 hours. 

3)  Add 30ul Phenol and 30ul Chloroform to the sample and mix by shaking the mixture for 2 min. Centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. 

4) In a new 1.5ml Eppendorf tube, add 50ul Phenol, 48ul Chloroform and 2ul Isoamyl alcohol. Add 60ul of this mixture to the sample tube and  centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. 

6)  Transfer the supernatant into a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube,  add 60 μL of absolute ethanol and centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 10 min.

7)  Carefully poipette off and discard the supernatant without disturbing the formed pellet. Wash the pellet by adding 50 μL of 70% ethanol and centrifuging at 13,000 rpm/10 min. 

8)  Repeat Step 7.

9)  Carefully poipette off and discard the supernatant without disturbing the formed pellet. Air dry the pellet for 1 hour. Add 50 μL sterile ddH2O and mix by pipetting up and down.
