Protocol:
!!! ALL PHENOL/CHOLROFORM STEPS TO BE CONDUCTED IN A FUME HOOD !!!

1)  *Insert bead beating tissue method here*

2)  Transfer sample into a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube containing 60μL lysis buffer and 5μL 20mg/ul Proteinase K. Incubate at 60°C for 3 hours. 

3)  Mix with 60μL Phenol:Chloroform (1:1) by shaking the mixture for 2 min and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. 
4)  The remaining supernatant was transferred into a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. 
5)  60 μL of Phenol: Chloroform: Isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) was added and the mixture was centrifuged (13,000 rpm/10 min). 
6)  Supernatant was transferred into a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, mixed with 60 μL of absolute ethanol and centrifuged (13,000 rpm/10 min). 
7)  The supernatant was discarded and the pellet formed was washed twice by adding 50 μL of 70% ethanol and centrifuged (13,000 rpm/10 min). 
8)  Pellet was air dried for about 1 h and dissolved in 50 μL sterile ddH2O.
